📈 Customer Churn Prediction & Analysis App

📖 Overview
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application designed to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. It helps businesses identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions and provides actionable insights through data analysis and customer segmentation.

The solution includes:
A Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
A Streamlit Web Application for real-time predictions, batch processing, and visual analytics.

✨ Key Features
Real-time Prediction: Enter individual customer details (Age, Tenure, Contract Type, etc.) to get an instant Churn/No-Churn prediction.
Batch Prediction: Upload a CSV or Excel file containing multiple customer records to generate predictions for the whole dataset.
Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes churn distribution, correlation heatmaps, and relationships between tenure and monthly charges.
Customer Segmentation: Uses K-Means Clustering to group customers into "Loyal," "At-Risk," and "Moderate Risk" categories to suggest retention strategies.
Actionable Insights: Provides automated suggestions based on data patterns (e.g., offering discounts to at-risk users).

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Streamlit: For building the interactive web interface.
Scikit-Learn: For model training (Decision Tree, SVC, KNN, Logistic Regression) and K-Means clustering.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and processing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

🚀 Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-prediction-app.git
cd churn-prediction-app
Install dependencies: Create a requirements.txt file (or run the command below directly) with the following libraries:

pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib openpyxl
Generate the Model: If best_model.pkl and scaler.pkl are not present, run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open Churn_nb.ipynb.
Run all cells to train the model and save the .pkl files.
Run the Application: You can run the comprehensive main app using:

streamlit run main.py

🧠 Model Workflow
The machine learning pipeline implemented in Churn_nb.ipynb follows these steps:

Data Loading: Reads customer data (Customer ID, Gender, Tenure, Charges, etc.).

Preprocessing:
Encodes categorical variables (Gender, ContractType, InternetService, TechSupport).
Scales numerical features using StandardScaler.
Model Selection: Tested multiple algorithms:
Logistic Regression (~89.5% accuracy)
K-Neighbors Classifier (~94% accuracy)
Support Vector Classifier (SVC) (~96% accuracy)
Decision Tree Classifier (~100% accuracy on test set - Selected Model)
Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to optimize the Decision Tree.

📊 How to Use the App
1. Single Prediction
Navigate to the prediction section.
Input the following details:
Age: Customer's age.
Gender: Male/Female.
Tenure: Months the customer has been with the company.
Monthly Charges: Amount paid monthly.
Contract Type: Month-to-Month, One Year, or Two Year.
Internet Service: Fiber Optic or DSL.
Tech Support: Yes/No.

Click Predict to see if the customer is likely to churn.

2. Batch Prediction
Upload a .csv or .xlsx file containing customer data.
The app will process the file, append a Churn_Prediction column, and allow you to download the results.

3. Customer Segmentation (in main.py)
Upload your predicted dataset.
The app automatically applies K-Means clustering to visualize:

🟦 Cluster 1: Loyal Customers (High tenure, stable charges).
🔴 Cluster 2: At-Risk Customers (Low tenure, high charges).
🟢 Cluster 3: Moderate Risk.


🔮 Future Improvements
Implement a Random Forest or XGBoost model for potentially more robust generalization.
Add user authentication for the web app.
Integrate an automated email system to send alerts for "At-Risk" customers.
